# Clangnu
A tool for Windows users to use gnu-based clang without adding the argument "-target xxx-pc-windows-gnu".


For now it only supports x86_64, but you can tailor it to your needs accompanied by the license if you want. 


# Usage
Use `clangnu` instead of `clang`, also, replace `clang++` with `clangnu++`. 


Notice that `clang` and `clangnu` should both be found in the system PATH.
